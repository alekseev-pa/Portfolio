### Purpose:
Evaluate the results of the loyalty program implementation, understand how the loyalty program worked, whether it is worth using it further.

### Project objectives:
- conduct an exploratory data analysis to show general situation;
- get the main retail metrics by cohorts from customers inside the loyalty program and outside it;
- analyze how the current loyalty program worked;
- test hypotheses;

### Skills and Tools

- **python**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Plotly**
- **A/B tests**

### Concluison

The effectiveness of the loyalty program was evaluated by two indicators: the average check per customer and the average number of purchases per customer.
